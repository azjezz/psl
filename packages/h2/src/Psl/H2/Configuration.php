     *  that send excessive empty frames, SETTINGS floods, or PING floods.
     * @param int $maxHeaderBlockSize Maximum accumulated header block size in bytes before HPACK decoding. 0 means unlimited.
     *  Protects against decompression bombs from malicious peers.
     * @param null|int<1, max> $maxReceiveWindowSize Maximum receive window size in bytes for BDP auto-tuning. When set,
     *  the connection dynamically adjusts the receive window based on measured throughput and RTT using PING round-trips. When null,
     *  BDP auto-tuning is disabled and receive windows are managed with per-frame WINDOW_UPDATE acknowledgements.
     * @param positive-int $writeBufferThreshold Buffered write data is flushed when it reaches this size in bytes.
     *  Higher values reduce syscall overhead at the cost of latency.
