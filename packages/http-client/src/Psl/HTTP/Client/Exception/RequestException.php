/**
 * Thrown when the request itself is invalid or cannot be dispatched.
 *
 * This exception indicates a problem with the request that is detected before
 * the HTTP exchange begins on the wire. Unlike {@see ProtocolException}, which
 * signals a server-side or transport-level protocol violation, this exception
 * signals that the client cannot even attempt the exchange because the request
 * is structurally unsound.
 *
 * Two categories of request errors are covered:
 *
 * 1. **Missing URL**: The request has no URL and no base URL is configured in
 *    the {@see Client\ClientConfiguration}. Thrown by {@see Client\Client}, {@see Client\Connection\Connector}, and
 *    {@see Client\Connection\PooledConnector},
 *
 * 2. **Invalid request structure**: The request violates HTTP semantics,
 *    such as a TRACE request that includes a body (forbidden by RFC 9110
 *    Section 9.3.8), or a request with a host header mismatch. Thrown by {@see Client\Client}
 *
 * @see RuntimeException Parent exception for all HTTP client errors.
 * @see ProtocolException For errors originating from the server response or transport protocol.
