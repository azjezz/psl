/**
 * HTTP/2 connection implementation backed by a multiplexed {@see H2Session}.
 *
 * Represents a single logical HTTP/2 connection that delegates exchanges to a
 * shared {@see H2Session}, which manages stream concurrency and frame I/O over
 * one TCP/TLS connection. Each exchange opens a new HTTP/2 stream via
 * {@see StreamExchange::exchange()}.
 *
 * When the underlying session is closed (e.g., server sent GOAWAY per
 * RFC 9113 Section 6.8, or an unrecoverable I/O error occurs), the connection
 * transparently reconnects through the pool via the reconnect closure, so
 * callers never see session lifecycle errors. This reconnection is attempted
 * at most once per exchange to avoid infinite loops.
 *
 * Unlike {@see H1\H1Connection}, HTTP/2 connections do not need
 * {@see finalize()} logic because stream multiplexing eliminates the
 * one-request-per-connection constraint; there is no connection to "release
 * back to the pool" after each exchange.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * @see H2Session Manages stream concurrency and the underlying H2 wire connection.
 * @see StreamExchange Performs the per-stream request/response exchange.
 * @see H2Multiplexer Dispatches H2 events to per-stream consumers.
