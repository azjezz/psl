/**
 * Background frame reader and per-stream event dispatcher for HTTP/2 connections.
 *
 * Runs a dedicated read fiber that reads H2 frames in a tight loop from the
 * underlying {@see ClientConnectionInterface} and dispatches events directly to
 * the registered {@see H2Stream} objects. The read fiber is started lazily when
 * the first stream is registered and cancelled automatically when the last
 * stream is unregistered, keeping the fiber alive only while there are active
 * consumers.
 *
 * The multiplexer handles the following event types:
 * - {@see Event\HeadersReceived}: routed to the target stream for response or trailer handling.
 * - {@see Event\DataReceived}: routed to the target stream's body buffer.
 * - {@see Event\StreamReset}: fails the target stream with a protocol exception (RST_STREAM).
 * - {@see Event\StreamClosed}: removes the stream from the registry.
 * - {@see Event\GoAwayReceived}: marks the session closed and fails streams above the last-stream-id.
 *
 * Fiber safety: the read fiber runs concurrently with the exchange fibers that
 * call {@see H2Stream::readBody()}. Synchronization between the read fiber and
 * consumer fibers happens through {@see H2Stream}'s suspension mechanism.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * @see H2Session Owns this multiplexer and manages stream concurrency.
 * @see H2Stream Per-stream state container that receives dispatched events.
 * @see StreamExchange Registers streams and sends request frames.
