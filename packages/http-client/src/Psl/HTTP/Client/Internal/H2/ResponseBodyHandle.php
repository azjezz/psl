/**
 * Lazy, pull-based read handle for HTTP/2 response bodies.
 *
 * Reads from an {@see H2Stream}'s body buffer, which is asynchronously fed
 * by the {@see H2Multiplexer}'s background read fiber. This handle has no
 * direct interaction with the read fiber; it only pulls from the stream's
 * local buffer via {@see H2Stream::readBody()} and {@see H2Stream::tryReadBody()}.
 *
 * Body size enforcement is performed inline: each successful read increments
 * a byte counter, and if the configured maximum response body size is exceeded,
 * the handle enters an error state and closes the stream. Unlike H1, where size
 * enforcement is done by wrapping with {@see IO\BoundedReadHandle}, H2 handles
 * enforce the limit directly because the body data arrives via the multiplexer's
 * push mechanism rather than a sequential read.
 *
 * Lifecycle: the handle unregisters the stream from the multiplexer when the
 * body is fully consumed, when an error occurs, or when the handle is explicitly
 * closed (including via garbage collection). This ensures the multiplexer does
 * not hold references to completed streams.
 *
 * Read contract:
 * - {@see read()} blocks (suspends the fiber) until data is available or EOF.
 * - {@see tryRead()} returns only buffered data without blocking.
 * - After EOF or error, both return '' and {@see reachedEndOfDataSource()} returns true.
 * - Once in an error state, all subsequent reads throw the recorded exception.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * @see H2Stream The per-stream state container holding the body buffer.
 * @see H2Multiplexer Dispatches DATA events that fill the stream's buffer.
 * @see StreamExchange Creates this handle when the response has a body.
