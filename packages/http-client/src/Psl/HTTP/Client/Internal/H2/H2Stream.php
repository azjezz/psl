/**
 * Per-stream state container for an HTTP/2 exchange.
 *
 * Acts as a shared buffer and synchronization point between the
 * {@see H2Multiplexer}'s background read fiber (producer) and the consumer
 * fiber ({@see StreamExchange} for response headers, {@see ResponseBodyHandle}
 * for body data). This decoupling means the read fiber can continue processing
 * events for other streams while a consumer is still reading the body.
 *
 * Data flow:
 * 1. The multiplexer calls {@see handleHeaders()} when HEADERS frames arrive.
 *    - If this is the first non-informational response, the response deferred is resolved.
 *    - If already resolved, the headers are treated as trailing headers.
 *    - 1xx informational responses are collected separately.
 * 2. The multiplexer calls {@see handleData()} when DATA frames arrive, appending
 *    to the body buffer and waking any suspended consumer.
 * 3. The multiplexer calls {@see fail()} on error (RST_STREAM, GOAWAY, I/O failure),
 *    which propagates the error to both the response deferred and the body consumer.
 *
 * Fiber safety: the producer (multiplexer read fiber) and consumer (exchange fiber)
 * never run concurrently within a single stream because PHP fibers are cooperative.
 * The body waiter suspension mechanism provides the handoff: the consumer suspends
 * when the buffer is empty, and the producer resumes it when data arrives.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * @see H2Multiplexer The producer that dispatches events into this stream.
 * @see StreamExchange Awaits the response headers via {@see awaitResponse()}.
 * @see ResponseBodyHandle Reads body data via {@see readBody()}.
