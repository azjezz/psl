/**

 * is reached, callers of {@see acquireStream()} are suspended until a slot is
 * released. The session also owns the {@see H2Multiplexer} that dispatches
 * frames to per-stream consumers.
 *
 * Lifecycle: a session is created when a new HTTP/2 connection is established
 * and marked closed when a GOAWAY frame is received (RFC 9113 Section 6.8) or
 * when an unrecoverable error occurs. Once closed, no new streams can be opened.
