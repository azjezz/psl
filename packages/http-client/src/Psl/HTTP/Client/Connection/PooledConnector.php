/**
 * Connection-pooling connector that reuses HTTP/1.x connections and shares HTTP/2 sessions.
 *
 * This is the default {@see ConnectorInterface} implementation used by {@see Client\Client}.
 * It maintains a pool of idle connections keyed by origin (scheme + host + port) and
 * automatically selects the appropriate protocol based on the resolved protocol versions
 * and ALPN negotiation results.
 *
 * ## HTTP/1.x connection pooling
 *
 * For HTTP/1.x connections, the connector maintains an idle pool of up to
 * {@see MAX_IDLE_CONNECTIONS} TCP streams per origin. When a request completes, the
 * underlying stream is returned to the idle pool (via a release callback) for reuse by
 * subsequent requests to the same origin. Idle connections that are closed by the server
 * or garbage-collected are automatically pruned on checkout. When the idle pool is full,
 * the oldest connections are evicted.
 *
 * Idle streams are held as strong references to keep them alive for reuse.
 * Streams that are closed by the server are pruned on checkout.
 *
 * ## HTTP/2 session sharing
 *
 * HTTP/2 multiplexes multiple requests over a single TCP connection. The connector
 * maintains one {@see H2Session} per origin and returns a new {@see H2Connection}
 * (representing one HTTP/2 stream) for each request. All concurrent requests to the
 * same origin share the same session and underlying TCP socket.
 *
 * If the session is closed (e.g., due to a GOAWAY frame or connection error), it is
 * removed from the pool and a new connection is established on the next request.
 *
 * ## Connection coalescing for HTTPS
 *
 * When multiple fibers concurrently request connections to the same HTTPS origin, the
 * first fiber performs the TLS handshake and ALPN negotiation. If HTTP/2 is negotiated,
 * waiting fibers reuse the established session instead of opening redundant connections.
 * If HTTP/1.1 is negotiated, waiting fibers are notified to establish their own
 * connections.
 *
 * This coalescing prevents a thundering-herd of TLS handshakes when many requests target
 * the same origin simultaneously.
 *
 * ## Unix socket connections
 *
 * When the configuration specifies a Unix domain socket, the connector bypasses DNS
 * resolution and TCP connection, connecting directly to the socket. HTTP/2
 * prior-knowledge mode is used when the resolved protocol versions contain only
 * {@see ProtocolVersion::V20}.
 *
 * ## Protocol version resolution
 *
 * Protocol version resolution follows the rules documented in {@see ConnectorInterface}.
 * For HTTPS connections, ALPN tokens ("h2", "http/1.1") are derived from the resolved
 * versions and advertised during the TLS handshake. The server's ALPN selection
 * determines which connection type is created.
