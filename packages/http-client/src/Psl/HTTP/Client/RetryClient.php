/**
 * Decorator that retries failed requests with exponential backoff.
 *
 * Wraps an inner {@see ClientInterface} and automatically retries requests that fail
 * with transport-level exceptions. Only idempotent HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, PUT,
 * DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE) are retried, as defined by RFC 9110 Section 9.2.2.
 * Non-idempotent methods (POST, PATCH) propagate the exception immediately to avoid
 * unintended side effects from duplicate submissions.
 *
 * ## Retry triggers
 *
 * Retries are triggered only by transport-level exceptions:
 *
 * - {@see Network\Exception\RuntimeException}: connection refused, DNS failure,
 *   connect timeout, connection reset.
 * - {@see IO\Exception\RuntimeException}: read/write failure on the underlying
 *   socket (e.g., broken pipe, unexpected EOF).
 *
 * All other exceptions propagate immediately without retry, including:
 *
 * - {@see Exception\RequestException}: invalid request (no URL).
 * - {@see Exception\ProtocolException}: malformed server response.
 * - {@see Exception\TooManyRedirectsException}: redirect limit exceeded.
 * - {@see Async\Exception\CancelledException}: cancellation token fired.
 *
 * ## Backoff strategy
 *
 * The delay between attempts grows exponentially using the formula:
 *
 *     delay = backoff * multiplier^(attempt - 1)
 *
 * With the default settings (backoff = 100ms, multiplier = 2), the delays are:
 * 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, and so on. The backoff sleep respects the cancellation token,
 * so cancelled requests do not wait for the backoff period to expire.
 *
 * ## Maximum attempts
 *
 * The {@see $maxAttempts} parameter controls the total number of attempts, including
 * the initial request. For example, with maxAttempts = 3, the client makes at most
 * 1 initial request + 2 retries. If all attempts fail, the exception from the last
 * attempt is propagated.
 *
 * ## Request body handling
 *
 * When a request has a body, retry behavior depends on whether the body is seekable:
 *
 * - **Seekable body** ({@see IO\SeekHandleInterface}): the body position is recorded
 *   before the first attempt via {@see IO\SeekHandleInterface::tell()}, and rewound
 *   via {@see IO\SeekHandleInterface::seek()} before each retry. This covers
 *   {@see IO\MemoryHandle}, file handles, and any other seekable stream.
 * - **Non-seekable body**: the request is NOT retried, even for idempotent methods.
 *   The body may have been partially or fully consumed by the first attempt, so
 *   retrying would send an incomplete or empty body. The exception from the first
 *   attempt propagates immediately.
 * - **No body** ({@see null}): retries proceed normally (nothing to rewind).
