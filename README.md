Psl is a standard library for PHP, inspired by [hhvm/hsl](https://github.com/hhvm/hsl).

The goal of Psl is to provide a consistent, centralized, well-typed set of APIs for PHP programmers.

## Example

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Psl\Async;
use Psl\TCP;
use Psl\IO;
use Psl\Shell;
use Psl\Str;

Async\main(static function(): int {
    IO\write_line('Hello, World!');

    [$version, $connection] = Async\concurrently([
        static fn() => Shell\execute('php', ['-v']),
        static fn() => TCP\connect('localhost', 1337),
    ]);

    $messages = Str\split($version, "\n");
    foreach($messages as $message) {
        $connection->writeAll($message);
    }

    $connection->close();

    return 0;
});
```
