# IO

The `IO` component provides handle-based I/O abstractions. Instead of reaching for global functions like `fread()` and `fwrite()`, you work with typed handle interfaces that make I/O composable, testable, and safe.

## Handle Interfaces

Handles are defined as narrow interfaces, each describing a single capability:

- **`ReadHandleInterface`** -- read bytes, check for EOF
- **`WriteHandleInterface`** -- write bytes
- **`SeekHandleInterface`** -- move the cursor position
- **`CloseHandleInterface`** -- explicitly close the handle, check if closed via `isClosed()`

A concrete handle implements whichever combination applies. For example, a file handle implements read, write, seek, and close, while a network socket implements read, write, and close but not seek.

### Buffered Interfaces

Two higher-level interfaces extend the base read and write interfaces for handles that buffer data internally:

- **`BufferedReadHandleInterface`** -- extends `ReadHandleInterface` with `readByte()`, `readLine()`, `readUntil()`, and `readUntilBounded()`. Implemented by `Reader`.
- **`BufferedWriteHandleInterface`** -- extends `WriteHandleInterface` with `flush()` for explicitly flushing buffered output. Useful for decorators like compression handles that accumulate data before writing.

## Quick Output

Convenience functions write directly to stdout or stderr:

@example('io/io-write.php')

All output functions support `sprintf`-style formatting.

## Standard Handles

Three functions return the process-level I/O handles:

@example('io/io-standard-handles.php')

In non-CLI SAPIs, `input_handle()` reads from `php://input` and `output_handle()` writes to `php://output`. `error_handle()` returns `null` outside CLI.

## MemoryHandle

`MemoryHandle` is an in-memory buffer implementing read, write, seek, and close. It is useful for testing code that accepts handle interfaces without touching the filesystem or network.

@example('io/io-memory-handle.php')

## Reader

`Reader` wraps any `ReadHandleInterface` and implements `BufferedReadHandleInterface`, providing buffered, higher-level reading methods:

@example('io/io-reader.php')

### Bounded Reads

`Reader::readUntilBounded()` works like `readUntil()` but enforces a maximum byte limit. If the suffix is not found within `$max_bytes`, an `IO\Exception\OverflowException` is thrown. This prevents unbounded memory consumption when reading from untrusted sources -- for example, capping HTTP header lines to a safe size so a malicious client cannot exhaust memory by sending an endless line.

@example('io/io-reader-bounded.php')

## Spool

`IO\spool()` creates a handle that writes to memory until a threshold is reached (default 2MB), then transparently spools to a temporary file on disk. This is useful when buffering data of unknown size without risking excessive memory usage.

@example('io/io-spool.php')

## Pipes

`IO\pipe()` creates a connected pair of handles: anything written to the write end can be read from the read end.

@example('io/io-pipe.php')

## Copying and Streaming

`IO\copy()` reads from one handle and writes to another until EOF:

@example('io/io-copy.php')

`IO\streaming()` multiplexes reads from several stream handles concurrently, yielding chunks as they arrive. This is useful for reading interleaved process output:

@example('io/io-streaming.php')

## Handle Decorators

PSL provides several decorator handles that wrap an existing handle and add behavior.

### IterableReadHandle

`IterableReadHandle` wraps an `iterable<string>` (array, generator, or any iterable) as a streaming `ReadHandleInterface`. The iterator is advanced lazily on each `read()` call, so the entire content is never buffered in memory.

@example('io/io-iterable-read-handle.php')

### ConcatReadHandle

`ConcatReadHandle` reads from two handles in sequence. It delegates to the first handle until EOF, then transparently switches to the second.

@example('io/io-concat-read-handle.php')

### TruncatedReadHandle

`TruncatedReadHandle` reads up to N bytes from the underlying handle. Once the limit is reached, it silently reports EOF regardless of whether more data is available. Data beyond the limit is neither consumed nor validated.

@example('io/io-truncated-read-handle.php')

### BoundedReadHandle

`BoundedReadHandle` reads up to N bytes from the underlying handle. Unlike `TruncatedReadHandle`, it peeks past the limit to check for overflow. If the underlying handle has more data, an `IO\Exception\RuntimeException` is thrown. Use this when exceeding the limit is a violation (e.g., HTTP response body size limits).

@example('io/io-bounded-read-handle.php')

### FixedLengthReadHandle

`FixedLengthReadHandle` reads exactly N bytes from the underlying handle. If the handle reaches EOF before N bytes are consumed, an `IO\Exception\RuntimeException` is thrown. Use this when the data source promises a specific length (e.g., HTTP Content-Length bodies, fixed-size protocol frames).

@example('io/io-fixed-length-read-handle.php')

### JoinedReadWriteHandle

`JoinedReadWriteHandle` combines a `ReadHandleInterface` and a `WriteHandleInterface` into a single bidirectional handle. All read operations delegate to the reader, all write operations delegate to the writer. It implements `BufferedWriteHandleInterface`, so calling `flush()` delegates to the underlying writer if it also implements `BufferedWriteHandleInterface`.

@example('io/io-joined-read-write-handle.php')

### TeeWriteHandle

`TeeWriteHandle` writes to two handles simultaneously. If the second handle is slower, data is buffered internally and drained on subsequent writes. It implements `BufferedWriteHandleInterface` -- call `flush()` to explicitly drain any pending data to the second handle. This is useful for mirroring output to a log, computing a hash while streaming, or duplicating data to two destinations.

@example('io/io-tee-write-handle.php')

### Sink Handles

`SinkWriteHandle` discards all written data, like `/dev/null`. `SinkReadHandle` is a read handle that always reports EOF immediately -- unlike `new MemoryHandle('')` which only reports EOF after the first read attempt. `SinkReadWriteHandle` combines both: writes are discarded and reads always report EOF. All write sinks implement `BufferedWriteHandleInterface` with a no-op `flush()` for compatibility with code that expects flushable writers. These are useful as no-op handles in tests or when output must be consumed but can be discarded.

@example('io/io-sink-handle.php')
