# HTTP Client

The `HTTP Client` component provides an async HTTP client with connection pooling, HTTP/2 multiplexing, automatic protocol negotiation via ALPN, middleware support, and composable decorators for redirects and retries. All I/O is non-blocking and built on the PSL async runtime.

## Basic Usage

Create a client, build a request, and send it. The returned transaction contains the response with status, headers, and a streaming body.

@example('protocols/http-client-basic.php')

## Sending Data

Send a POST request with a JSON body and custom headers using `IO\MemoryHandle` for the request body.

@example('protocols/http-client-sending-data.php')

## Concurrent Requests

Use `Async\concurrently()` to send multiple requests in parallel over the same client. HTTP/2 connections are automatically multiplexed.

@example('protocols/http-client-concurrent.php')

## Redirects

`RedirectClient` wraps any client and automatically follows 3xx redirects with credential stripping on cross-origin hops and method rewriting per RFC 9110.

@example('protocols/http-client-redirects.php')

## Retries

`RetryClient` wraps any client and retries idempotent requests on transport-level failures with exponential backoff.

@example('protocols/http-client-retries.php')

## Configuration

`ClientConfiguration` controls TLS settings, protocol version preferences, response size limits, base URL, and proxy configuration.

@example('protocols/http-client-configuration.php')

## Per-Request Overrides

`SendConfiguration` overrides specific client settings for a single request without affecting the client default.

@example('protocols/http-client-send-configuration.php')

## SSRF Protection

`DeniedDestinationsMiddleware` inspects the resolved peer IP after connection establishment and blocks requests to private, loopback, and link-local addresses.

@example('protocols/http-client-ssrf.php')

## Proxy Modes

The client supports three proxy modes, configured via `ClientConfiguration` or overridden per-request via `SendConfiguration`:

- **No proxy** (default): The client connects directly to the target server.
- **HTTP proxy** (`$proxyConfiguration`): Configured via a `ProxyConfiguration` object that holds the proxy URL, optional `Proxy-Authorization` header, TLS SNI hostname, and bypass list. For HTTPS targets, the client connects to the proxy and issues an HTTP/1.1 CONNECT request to create a tunnel. For plain HTTP targets, the client connects to the proxy directly and uses absolute-form request targets per RFC 7230 Section 5.3.2 (forward proxying). The `$skipProxyFor` list on the configuration specifies hosts that bypass the proxy entirely.
- **SOCKS5 proxy** (`$socksConfiguration`): All TCP connections are routed through the SOCKS5 proxy server. TLS, ALPN negotiation, and HTTP framing happen on top of the tunneled connection unchanged.

Both proxy types can be combined: when both `$socksConfiguration` and `$proxyConfiguration` are set, the SOCKS5 proxy tunnels the TCP connection to the HTTP proxy, which then handles HTTP forward proxying or CONNECT tunneling.

## SOCKS Proxy

Route all TCP connections through a SOCKS5 proxy using `$socksConfiguration`. TLS and ALPN negotiation happen on top of the tunneled connection.

@example('protocols/http-client-proxy.php')

## HTTP Proxy

Use `$proxyConfiguration` to route requests through an HTTP proxy. Configure the proxy URL, authentication, and bypass rules via `ProxyConfiguration`. HTTPS targets use CONNECT tunneling while plain HTTP targets use forward proxying with absolute-form request targets.

@example('protocols/http-client-tunnel.php')

## HTTP/2 over Plaintext (h2c)

For servers that support HTTP/2 without TLS, set `protocolVersions` to only `ProtocolVersion::V20`. The client uses prior-knowledge mode per RFC 9113 Section 3.4 - it sends the HTTP/2 connection preface directly on the TCP connection, skipping TLS and ALPN negotiation entirely.

@example('protocols/http-client-h2c.php')

## Request Body Rules

TRACE requests that include a body are rejected with a `RequestException` per RFC 9110 Section 9.3.8. GET and HEAD requests are allowed to carry a body (useful for Elasticsearch-style query bodies), although this is not recommended per RFC 9110 Section 9.3.1.

@example('protocols/http-client-body-rules.php')

## Callbacks

`SendConfiguration` provides two per-request callbacks for observing connection and protocol events:

- `onConnection(ConnectionMetadata): void` fires immediately after a connection is acquired (fresh or pooled), before the HTTP exchange. Use it to inspect the peer IP, local address, and TLS negotiation state.
- `onInformationalResponse(Response): void` fires for each 1xx response as it arrives (100 Continue, 103 Early Hints, etc.).

`ClientConfiguration` also accepts an `onInformationalResponse` callback that applies to all requests. When both the client-level and per-request callbacks are set, the client-level callback fires first, followed by the per-request callback.

@example('protocols/http-client-callbacks.php')

## Informational Responses

HTTP servers may send one or more 1xx informational responses before the final response. These are delivered in two ways:

1. The `onInformationalResponse` callback (on `ClientConfiguration` or `SendConfiguration`) fires as each 1xx response arrives.
2. All 1xx responses are collected in `Transaction::$informational` in chronological order.

Common informational responses include 100 Continue (the server is ready for the request body), 102 Processing (WebDAV, long-running operation), and 103 Early Hints (preliminary headers for resource preloading per RFC 8297).

@example('protocols/http-client-informational.php')

## Connection Metadata

`ConnectionMetadata` captures the transport-level details of a connection at acquisition time. It is available through the `onConnection` callback on `SendConfiguration`.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `localAddress` | `Network\Address` | Local socket endpoint (IP and ephemeral port) |
| `peerAddress` | `Network\Address` | Resolved remote address after DNS resolution |
| `tlsState` | `TLS\ConnectionState` or `null` | TLS session details for HTTPS, `null` for plaintext |

The `TLS\ConnectionState` includes `version`, `cipherName`, `cipherBits`, `alpnProtocol`, `peerCertificate`, and `peerCertificateChain`.

## Configuration Merging

`SendConfiguration` fields override the client's `ClientConfiguration` on a per-request basis via `ClientConfiguration::withOverrides()`. Null fields in `SendConfiguration` inherit from the client default; non-null fields replace the client value for that request only.

The following fields are overridable per-request:

| Field | Overridable |
|-------|-------------|
| `maxResponseHeaderSize` | Yes |
| `maxResponseBodySize` | Yes |
| `baseUrl` | Yes |
| `tlsConfiguration` | Yes |
| `protocolVersions` | Yes |
| `proxyConfiguration` | Yes |
| `onInformationalResponse` | Yes (merged, not replaced) |
| `socksConfiguration` | No (client-only) |
| `unixSocket` | No (client-only) |
| `h2ClientConfiguration` | No (client-only) |

> The `onInformationalResponse` callback receives special treatment: when both the client and send configuration define one, they are composed into a single callback that invokes the client-level callback first, then the per-request callback.

> All other overridable fields, including `proxyConfiguration`, are fully replaced by the per-request value when set. For example, setting `proxyConfiguration` on `SendConfiguration` completely overwrites the client-level proxy settings; they are not merged.

## Middleware

Connection-level middleware runs after the connection is established but before the HTTP exchange. Middleware has access to the `ConnectionInterface`, including the resolved peer address and TLS state. This enables security checks (SSRF protection), logging, metrics, and request/response transformation.

Middleware must do one of two things:

1. **Delegate**: Call `$handler->handle(...)` to continue the chain. The handler calls `finalize()` internally.
2. **Short-circuit**: Return a `Transaction` directly. When short-circuiting, you MUST call `$connection->finalize()` on the transaction before returning it. Without finalization, the underlying connection is never released back to the pool, causing a connection leak.

Middleware is registered via the `Client` constructor and applied in order: the first middleware in the list is the outermost (executed first).

@example('protocols/http-client-middleware.php')

## HTTP/1.0 Mode

Setting `protocolVersions` to `[ProtocolVersion::V10]` sends HTTP/1.0 requests. Connection: close is implicit per RFC 1945, so each request uses a separate TCP connection. Keep-alive and chunked transfer encoding are not available. Trailers are not supported.

@example('protocols/http-client-http10.php')

## Trailers

Request trailers are sent via `Request::$trailers`, an `Awaitable<FieldMap>` that resolves after the body. Response trailers are available via `Response::$trailers`, which resolves after the response body is fully consumed.

Trailers require chunked transfer encoding (HTTP/1.1) or HTTP/2 DATA frames. They are not available with HTTP/1.0. Declare expected trailer field names using the `Trailer` header.

@example('protocols/http-client-trailers.php')

## Connection Pooling

The default `PooledConnector` manages connection reuse across requests:

- **HTTP/1.x**: Idle connections are pooled per origin (scheme + host + port) with LIFO checkout. When a request completes and the body is fully consumed, the underlying TCP/TLS stream is returned to the pool. A global cap of 256 idle connections and a per-host cap of 32 prevent unbounded memory growth.
- **HTTP/2**: A single multiplexed connection per origin is shared across concurrent requests. Each request opens one HTTP/2 stream on the shared connection. If the connection is closed (GOAWAY frame or connection error), it is removed and a new connection is established on the next request.
- **Connection coalescing**: When multiple fibers concurrently request connections to the same HTTPS origin, the first fiber performs the TLS handshake. If HTTP/2 is negotiated, waiting fibers reuse the session instead of opening redundant connections. If HTTP/1.1 is negotiated, waiting fibers establish their own connections.

## Pool Release and Finalize

For HTTP/1.x keep-alive connections, the pooled connection is not released until the response body is fully consumed. The response body handle defers the pool release until EOF or close. This prevents a second request from reusing a connection while the first response body is still being read.

This is why middleware that short-circuits the handler chain MUST call `$connection->finalize()`: finalize wraps the response body (if any) so the connection is properly returned to the pool. Without it, the connection leaks.

For HTTP/2 connections, stream lifecycle is managed independently, so finalize returns the transaction as-is.

## Error Handling

The client throws a structured exception hierarchy. Transport-level exceptions from `Psl\Network` and `Psl\IO` propagate unwrapped.

@example('protocols/http-client-errors.php')

## Exception Hierarchy

| Exception | When Thrown |
|-----------|------------|
| `Exception\RuntimeException` | Base class for all HTTP client errors |
| `Exception\RequestException` | Request is invalid (missing URL, malformed target, TRACE with body) |
| `Exception\ProtocolException` | Malformed response, unsupported protocol, body size exceeded |
| `Exception\TooManyRedirectsException` | Redirect limit exceeded (via `RedirectClient`) |
| `Network\Exception\RuntimeException` | Connection refused, DNS failure, connect timeout |
| `IO\Exception\RuntimeException` | Read/write failure on the underlying socket |
| `Async\Exception\CancelledException` | Cancellation token fired during any stage |

## Protocol Support

| Version | Transport | Negotiation | Multiplexing | Status |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| HTTP/1.0 | TCP / TLS | Explicit | No | Supported |
| HTTP/1.1 | TCP / TLS | Default fallback | No (persistent connections) | Supported |
| HTTP/2 | TLS (h2) / TCP (h2c) | ALPN | Yes (streams over single connection) | Supported |
| HTTP/3 | QUIC | ALPN | Yes (independent streams, no HOL blocking) | Planned |

> HTTP/3 support is not yet available. The client's connector and connection abstractions are designed to accommodate QUIC-based transports in the future without breaking the public API.
