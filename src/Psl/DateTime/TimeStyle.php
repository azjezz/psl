 * Enum representing time format styles.

 * to be included in time representations. The styles allow for a range from no time (None) to full detail (Full).
 *
 * - None: No time formatting.
 * - Short: Short format, typically for hour and minute (e.g., 5:30 PM).
 * - Medium: Medium format, which may include hour, minute, and second (e.g., 5:30:00 PM).
 * - Long: Long format, providing detailed time information often including time zone (e.g., 5:30:00 PM PST).
 * - Full: Full format, offering the most detailed time representation, including hour, minute, second, and time zone (e.g., 5:30:00 PM Pacific Standard Time).
 *
 * The default format style is Medium.
