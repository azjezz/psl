 * Enum representing date format styles.

 * This enum is used to specify the style of date formatting operations, allowing for varying levels of detail.
 * The styles range from no date (None) to a fully detailed date representation (Full).
 *
 * - None: No date formatting.
 * - Short: Short format that typically includes numeric values (e.g., 12/31/2020).
 * - Medium: Medium format that provides a balance between brevity and detail (e.g., Jan 31, 2020).
 * - Long: Long format that includes full month names and often includes the day of the week (e.g., Friday, January 31, 2020).
 * - Full: Full format that provides the most detail, often including the full day and month names, and the year in full (e.g., Friday, January 31, 2020).
 *
 * The default format style is Medium.
